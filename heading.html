<p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many <strong>students define</strong> paragraphs in
        terms of length: <h1>a paragraph </h1>is a group of at least five sentences,
         a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity 
         and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.
          A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single
           sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and
            appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a
             paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly 
             journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. 
             Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that
              support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as
              the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in 
              the rest of the paragraph.</p>
      ” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.</p>
